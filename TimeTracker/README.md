TimeTracker by Konstantin Bork

.h2 Some background
This small program is a client for a time tracking application. My problem was to track my
working time in my job. In our company we do not have a system to do that. For my interest
and for some other reasons I developed a server application to solve that. With this client
I access my server to start or finish the tracking.

.h2 Further requirements
You must have a file named "timetracker.config" in the same folder as this client. You can
take the "timetracker.config.example" file, edit it with your data and rename it so you can
use this application for your purposes.
